**Text:** <@1095116549674762281> Our protect rpc is designed for normal wallet usage (e.g. metamask). If you are interested in sending private txs you can take a look at https://docs.bloxroute.com/apis/frontrunning-protection

## Message 7

**Text:** Use latest confirmed block number + 1 should be a good approach. You can also want to check if the target tx lands on chain in this expected block number.

## Message 8

**Text:** It's what I currently do.
But I always get SentToMiners as false.
The simulation pass just fine. So my bundle should be fine

## Message 9

**Text:** Might it be because I was unlucky and all the block I targetted weren't Flashbots one?

## Message 10

**Text:** What if I just want to send a transaction AFTER one that came in the mempool. Just as fast as possible after I detect it in the mempool (it's a liq addition, I want to do SwapToken after that)

## Message 11

**Text:** You may want to check with flashbots team to see why your bundle has `SentToMiners` as false in their response. They should be able to share more insights in terms of how your bundle was handled in their backend.
