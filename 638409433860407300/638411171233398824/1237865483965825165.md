## Message 1

**Text:** Can you be more specific about "failed"?
Do you mean the tx doesn't land on chain, or lands on onchain but with failed execution status?

**Text:** Might be that the network is more congested than it was before, in that case, using a high priority fee would help. Plus, you may also want to check the priority fee values used by other on-chain txs and make sure your fee is no less than theirs.

In addition, for testing purpose, you may also consider using "false" for `skipPreFlight` flag when submitting the tx to see if there is any error with your tx content (for example, if there is an error with tx signing, you would see some relevant errors if you use false for this flag)

Also make sure to use false for `frontRunningProtection` flag, otherwise, if your tx execution fails, the tx would not land on chain at all.
