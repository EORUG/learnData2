**Text:** <@760612392093745172> hey if I want to trace whether a private tx is sent via bloXroute BackRunMe service or protect RPC, is there any api for me to check? I found this page but it does not support tracing private txs: https://docs.bloxroute.com/apis/tx-trace

**Text:** We do not offer an API that will tell you if a tx was submitted via backRunMe bundle. You can assume a tx was sent private if you receive a response from tx trace like `"message":"received no info about transaction"`
