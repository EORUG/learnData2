**Text:** Hello, I've stuck. Some members of the team, I'm sure, know about it üôÇ Basically what am I doing is I take a random tx(just for testing) from mempool, then create my own(ETH transfer) and pass them like [targetTx, myTx] - backrun. For my purpose I need bundle to be included in the nearest block. My tx is okay, maxPriority is high enough. A had a variety of errors and done with them, but one is constantly blocks me after them. Here is it:
```
Bundle Trace
{
  bundle_hash: "0x8a81f91ac5c8b3e6606c4fd215a2e86f6284c2238cae2a9b65be826acb93a54e",
  block_number: 19620046,
  bloXroute: [ "Receive time: 2024-04-09 19:04:08.436475.", "Initial simulation: No errors.",
    "Effective gas price: 65.81 gwei.", "% blocks bundle was included: 0", "bundle had final simulation error."
  ],
  on_chain_status: "Bundle was not included in the on-chain block.",
}
```

```
The targetTx is sucessfully included in the block number which I sent.
This is pretty much all, SOS üôè
