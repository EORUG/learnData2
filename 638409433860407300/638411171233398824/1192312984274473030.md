**Text:** If you were using a script to subscribe to ws stream, then it might be a problem with your script.

You may consider following the examples to use a simple 'wscat' command to directly subscribe to the stream from command line, which should usually work fine.

**Text:** Thanks for letting us know. For the issue in Japan region, we hope to get it resolved soon.
As you mentioned, you should be able to disable certificate verification temporarily in order to make it work.

## Message 6

**Text:** You may want to check if your target block number on chain was built by flashbots builder or not. If the on chain block was not built by flashbots builder (e.g. if its a block produced by validator locally), then it was not possible for your bundle to get into that specific block number.
It might be a good idea to check with flashbots team to learn more about what happened to your bundle.
