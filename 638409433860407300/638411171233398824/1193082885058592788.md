## Message 1

**Text:** One question, is it possible to send a transaction valid just for the next block only, I want my transaction discarded if it is not included in the next block.

## Message 4

**Text:** Should I just send a tx as soon as I see it in the mempool (liquidity addition) with x2 gas than the tx of liquidity addition, so that I am placed either later in the same block or in the very few next one?

## Message 6

**Text:** The issue I find is that if I set gas too high, I get positionned after in the block

## Message 7

**Text:** For example I did a x2, and I got 4th in the block position with my SwapToken tx (which I send whenever I see the liquidity tx), and the l√†iquidity tx is 30th, so I guess my buy would fail? (uniswap)

## Message 8

**Text:** You can consider using mev bundle approach, the first tx in the bundle can be target tx, the second tx in the bundle can be your tx to buy the token.

## Message 9

**Text:** You can specify a block number in the mev bundle request. Your bundle would be considered as valid for this one block number only.
